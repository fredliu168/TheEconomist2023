Fifteen years after the launch of the iPhone, most people understand the bargain with smartphones. You get navigation anywhere in the world, the web and email on the go and as much music as you can stream—but first you must sacrifice a bit of privacy. Your location, preferences and habits will be transmitted to some faceless corporation to be parsed for insights and sold on to advertisers keen to sell you shampoo or car insurance.
Some companies profit from tools that allow people to be snooped on without their consent. NSO Group, an Israeli firm, is probably the best known. It sells Pegasus, a piece of spyware that allows the program’s operators—typically spies and secret police—to see everything a mobile phone’s owner does. By reading messages directly off the phone’s screen, it can bypass the encryption built into apps such as WhatsApp or Signal. Pegasus can even surreptitiously activate a phone’s camera and microphone, uploading whatever it hears or sees to its controllers.
NSO made headlines in 2021 when Amnesty International and a group of media organisations, led by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based non-profit venture, reported on a leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers that appeared to be possible targets selected by Pegasus’s various operators around the world. NSO insists that governments purchase its tools to catch “terrorists, criminals and paedophiles”. Yet the leaked list included phones belonging to activists, journalists, lawyers and politicians. Among those appearing were Emmanuel Macron, France’s president;  in India; Roula Khalaf, the editor of the ; and, according to his wife, the family of , a Saudi journalist murdered and dismembered by his own government in its consulate in Istanbul in 2018. (NSO has denied that Pegasus was used to target Khashoggi or his family.)
In “Pegasus” Laurent Richard and Sandrine Rigaud of Forbidden Stories tell of how they turned the leak into an exposé. The book offers  which, like so many Israeli startups, is stuffed with geeks who honed their skills in the army. It explains the technical basics and Pegasus’s growing sophistication. Early versions of the malware relied on users clicking on links in text messages, a hit-and miss strategy; subsequent versions were able to infect phones without any user interaction.
But the book is more a journalistic memoir than a technical analysis of Pegasus, or a profile of its creators. The authors describe a mix of excitement and paranoia after obtaining the list. They draw attention to a growing trend in journalism: leaks so enormous that several outlets have to work together to check and make sense of them. The story is told mostly through pen portraits of those affected by the spying that Pegasus enabled, including Azeri and Moroccan journalists with a penchant for reporting on official misdeeds, to the displeasure of their autocratic rulers. 
The book is not perfect. The character sketches can feel a bit repetitive. Sometimes the authors go too far down rabbit holes or stray into airport-thriller-style hyperbole. (At one point Pegasus is described, rather ludicrously, as being like “loose nukes, gettable for the right amount of money”.) And although it mentions several of NSO’s less well-known—and less publicity-hungry—competitors, readers may feel that more pages could have been spent outlining the size and rapid growth of the .
NSO’s story is not over. The firm has been hit by lawsuits from WhatsApp and . Hanan Elatr, Khashoggi’s widow, is reportedly planning to sue. Last year America slapped it with the same sorts of export restrictions it has applied to Huawei, cutting it off from American microchips and software. For those wanting to catch up on the drama so far—or for politicians, journalists or ceos wondering how best to calibrate their paranoia—the book is a good place to start. ■
