There comes a point when culture wars and populism impair a country’s institutions, society and economy. That moment has arrived in Israel, where on February 20th the Knesset, or parliament, is due to hold the first reading of a . The bill is the project of a coalition government led by Binyamin Netanyahu that was formed after elections in November and which includes parties from Israel’s far right. In all but the rarest cases, it will prevent the Supreme Court from striking down laws that have passed through the Knesset. And it gives politicians more sway over judicial appointments. Israel’s unwritten constitution is flawed, but the changes would make things worse by allowing nearly unchecked majority rule. That could make the country less prosperous, more polarised at home and more vulnerable abroad.
Part of the motivation for the reforms is personal—Mr Netanyahu is fighting corruption charges and has grown to despise the courts. But Israel’s judicial system also has genuine problems. The country has no formal constitution. Instead, the Knesset has over the years passed “basic laws” that describe institutions and establish rights. In the 1990s, after over 40 years of relative restraint, the Supreme Court suddenly asserted that these laws transcended normal legislation, and arrogated to itself the right to overrule the Knesset if it thought they were contravened. Such judicial activism was not widely envisioned when the basic laws were passed, sometimes with slim majorities. It has fed a sense that the judiciary is a creature of the old left-leaning secular elite, and out of touch with religious and right-wing Israelis.
Though no definitive draft of the bill yet exists, it is likely to include two radical changes. It will severely limit the ability of the Supreme Court to override the Knesset, or allow a simple majority of the Knesset to overrule Supreme Court decisions. And it will award the government a decisive say over the appointment of judges, who are currently picked by a panel in which lawyers and judges outnumber politicians.
One reason the bill is dangerous is that it leaves Israel with few checks and balances. The Knesset has only one chamber, unlike many legislatures, and Israel’s largely ceremonial president cannot block laws. Under the reforms, a government with a narrow majority could do almost anything it wanted. This would amount to majoritarian rule, a project that Mr Netanyahu has long flirted with. He and his coalition partners say they are enabling “the will of the people” to prevail. But liberal democracies require : they also need institutions to prevent an individual from wielding too much power and to protect the rights of individuals and minorities. 
Majoritarianism is especially dangerous in Israel, because of its particular nature as a state. A fifth of citizens are Arabs, who are equal in law but often face discrimination. In addition, splits between Jewish Israelis—left and right, secular and orthodox—can be bitter. Extremist parties, once marginal, are now part of the ruling coalition. Israel also has responsibilities in the West Bank, and though Palestinians would deny that it delivers justice there, the Supreme Court has sometimes been a restraining influence on the expansion of settlements. All countries need judicious checks on power; volatile, divided ones doubly so. 
Israeli liberals are up in arms. Big street protests have erupted. Bosses have spoken out. Mr Netanyahu and his government may not much care—their opponents’ outrage is useful ammunition in the culture wars. But he must recognise that the damage from impairing the rule of law will go deep. 
Stability within Israel could be threatened if Arab citizens believe the state cannot protect their rights. Israel’s economic miracle depends on mobile capital and a liberal, globalised  that generated 54% of goods-and-services exports in 2021. The fear of unrestrained majority rule could further inflame tensions in the West Bank. And the sense that Israel is departing from liberal values will erode support in America, its vital security partner, as President Joe Biden signalled this week.
Mr Netanyahu should halt the legislative process, as Isaac Herzog, Israel’s president, has proposed. The judicial and political systems could certainly improve. Judges could be more representative. Relations between courts and parliament could be better defined. But it matters how constitutional reforms are decided. A broad, cross-party consensus should first form, perhaps in a constituent assembly. In many ways this is Israel’s moment. Its economy is thriving, it has new friendships in the Arab world through the Abraham accords and Iran, its great enemy, faces unrest at home. Instead of capitalising on this moment Mr Netanyahu is pursuing reforms that will make Israel weaker. He should change course.■
