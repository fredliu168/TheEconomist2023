FOR ALMOST as long as it has been accepted in China that “to get rich is glorious”, it has also been known that to get out can be glorious, too. The urge felt by many newly well-off Chinese citizens to be able to move to another country has been a big reason for the growth of  businesses, which can help organise such moves. According to the Investment Migration Council, a lobby for the industry, more than 80 countries now offer schemes in which fast-track residence rights (“golden visas”), or even citizenship (“golden passports”), are available to foreigners who invest in the country. The most popular programme has been America’s; for Chinese citizens there is a 15-year waiting-list. For small countries such as Vanuatu and St Kitts and Nevis citizenship-by-investment schemes are important sources of foreign exchange.
China is the biggest source of demand, but far from the only one. People all over the world want to move countries—to flee persecution, political instability or, in some cases, justice. Or, more prosaically, many simply hope to secure a better education for their children or to work somewhere with a pleasant climate and good cuisine. Under these schemes they bring their host country welcome investment. It seems a win-win arrangement. Yet, as the closure this month of schemes in both Ireland and Portugal demonstrates, they are highly controversial, especially in the .
The investment itself may sometimes be seen as a problem. In most schemes property purchases qualify as investments, which can cause resentment. Some, such as , widely seen as one of the most attractive in Europe, are judged to have been too successful. Its closure was announced on February 17th as part of a package of measures designed to tackle Portugal’s housing crisis. Foreign purchases were blamed for pushing the cost of buying or renting property out of the reach of many locals.
The scheme required investment or the acquisition of property worth at least €500,000 ($534,000), or a rather smaller sum in “low-density” areas or in particular parts of towns in need of regeneration. More than €6bn has been invested over the years. It gave a five-year residence visa which, since Portugal is part of the EU’s “Schengen area” in which there are no border checks, allowed free travel through most of the EU. After five years holders can apply for permanent residence in Portugal, as well as for citizenship and an EU passport, allowing them to live and work elsewhere in the EU. More than 5,000 Chinese have acquired such visas, along with more than 1,000 Brazilians and more than 500 people from each of America, South Africa and Turkey.
Ireland’s announcement of the closure of its own scheme to new applicants came two days before Portugal’s. This time, the effect on the local market seems to have been less of a concern than political pressure. Simon Harris, the justice minister, said Ireland had “taken on board a number of reports and findings from international bodies such as the EU Commission, Council of Europe and OECD on similar investment programmes” The commission and the OECD, a rich-country think-tank, have long worried that golden visas may provide cover for money-laundering and tax evasion. They have indeed been . In Greece, for example, Chinese investors were in 2018 accused of complicity in a scam in which a Greek developer bought properties at market value and sold them at a big mark-up to would-be investment migrants in China (and then partially reimbursed them).
In every country the question of who has the right to live there is a sensitive one. But for the EU in particular golden visas raise fundamental issues. They touch on one of the most “national” of competences—who lives in a country—yet, because of the Schengen arrangements, have Union-wide consequences. So there has been a prolonged tussle between Brussels and the countries offering visas and passports in return for investment. Last year, the European Parliament called for an outright ban on golden passports and the imposition of strict rules on golden visas. On passports, Brussels seems to be winning. In 2020 Cyprus closed its citizenship-by-investment programme, leaving only two still open in Europe (in Bulgaria and Malta). On visas, following Ireland and Portugal, Spain is facing calls to drop its scheme, which allows permanent residency after ten years. Now outside the EU, Britain ended its golden-visa programme last year. Greece, meanwhile, has a surge of applicants ahead of a doubling in May of its minimum required investment, to €500,000. With options dwindling, securing a golden visa to Europe seems to have become a race against time. ■
