America’s Justice Department sued to block  takeover of , arguing that their combination would eliminate competition on hundreds of routes and increase air fares.

A shortage of  in Britain caused unit sales of tomatoes and peppers to drop by around 17% in February, according to NIQ, a market-research firm. But the unit sales of some vegetables did grow, even though adverse weather in exporting regions made them hard to find; cucumbers were up by 32%.
