###### Not like that, minister

A dose of competence goes a long way in British politics. Last week the budget provided a welcome contrast to its chaotic predecessor. This week Boris Johnson’s blustering testimony to Parliament’s privileges committee reminded Britons just what they have not been missing. Ministers who know what they are doing and care about detail can make a big difference. But that should not obscure a set of underlying problems with how the British state functions. Those problems are at the core of a series of articles that intends to publish this year. 
The first problem concerns the machinery of government. Some of this is literally machinery: nearly half of all technology spending across government before the pandemic was dedicated to keeping outdated legacy systems running. But it is also wonk-speak for the , the half-a-million-strong engine of Britain’s government. From policy mavens to prison officers, civil servants advise ministers and turn government plans into action. The service has a proud reputation and lots of able people. Unfortunately, it also has a long list of weaknesses. 
The cult of the gifted amateur, whereby the Sir Humphreys of the future build their careers by jumping from problem to problem rather than cultivating expertise, is an old complaint. The problem of internal churn, which is higher in Britain’s public administration than in comparable countries, has worsened. The ebb and flow of civil-service numbers in the past decade, after years of austerity and the demands of Brexit and covid-19, mean that less experienced officials are in more senior posts. Worsening relations with ministers have eroded the tradition that trusted officials provide candid advice to their elected masters. 
Some changes are already in train—to pay, so that specialist expertise is rewarded, and to evaluation (only nine of the government’s 108 most significant projects in 2019 were robustly assessed). However, more radical reforms are needed. The heart of Britain’s system of government is too much of a black box. Civil servants have only limited mechanisms to signal concern about ministerial proposals, and they are required to represent ministers in their public appearances. One idea is to publish officials’ advice to ministers. Some worry that this will make the government too risk-averse, but the evidence from New Zealand is that it does not inhibit candid discussion. Although greater public scrutiny would be a seismic change to the way the British civil service operates, it is a necessary one. 
That is because of the scale and urgency of two other problems. A huge concern is British productivity, which has grown at less than half its pre-financial-crisis rate since 2010. That is not just the government’s headache to cure; but it is one that the state exacerbates. Fiscal power is too concentrated on Whitehall. Only 6% of tax revenue in Britain is collected by local government, a tiny share compared with other countries. A short-termist approach also hampers growth-enhancing initiatives, as shown by the recent decision to delay yet again the completion of HS2, a very-low-speed rail project. The planning system makes quagmires look slick. The Centre for Cities, a think-tank, pins stagnant productivity in London on difficulties in building houses and offices, among other things.
The third problem is the condition of public services. The state is getting bigger. The Office for Budget Responsibility, a watchdog, reckons that the tax burden will reach a post-war high of 37.7% of GDP later this decade. But with some exceptions, such as education, it is not producing better results. The latest data paint a pretty bleak picture: life expectancy stalling; falling trust in the police; staffing difficulties in children’s social care.
Slashing spending isn’t a plausible option. The public appetite for cuts is low; large parts of the state need more capital investment; and the lesson of austerity is that salami-slicing does not pay. But spending ever more money on the same services is not an answer either (supposing pots of money were available). The productivity of the NHS has declined since the pandemic, even as more cash has gone in. Instead radical rethinking is required: to shift the NHS to a model less focused on hospital care; to reduce one of the highest incarceration rates in western Europe; to change the tax system so as to encourage enterprise. 
Getting over the Humphrey
The good news is that these problems are more manageable than they may seem. Britain is a place where a powerful national government can click its fingers and change everything. That is both bad, because too many decisions flow through Whitehall, and good, because it is possible to be more radical than in Germany, say, or America. Britain has overhauled its state before, in the aftermath of the second world war and to escape the stagnation of the 1970s. It is time to do so again. ■
