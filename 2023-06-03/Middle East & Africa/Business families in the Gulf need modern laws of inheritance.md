“I love you, but you are not serious people,” says Logan Roy, the fictitious media mogul, to his feuding, grasping children in the TV series “Succession”. The same may be said by many an anguished tycoon in the Gulf as he struggles to arrange a harmonious handover to the next generation. The current laws are often either non-existent or inadequate for dealing with increasingly complex business structures when the great man dies. Some Gulf governments are beginning to enact laws to settle such family matters harmoniously. 
Take the Kuwaiti brothers Bassam and Kutayba Alghanim. The pair were embroiled in a succession dispute over their family’s huge conglomerate that lasted for years. At first the brothers sought to divide the business up amicably. But accusations and recriminations ensued, causing bad blood among the extended family. Kuwait’s rulers even stepped in to try to sort it all out. 
Such family disputes in the Gulf may be getting commoner. The firms’ reputations often suffer, decision-making can be paralysed and businesses can sometimes implode altogether. Fadi Hammadeh, who advises the Family Business Council-Gulf, an outfit based in Dubai that seeks to help family firms cross generations, says that dozens of rows within such businesses are being expensively adjudicated in the courts of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
This particularly affects succession and inheritance. Extended families can be enormous, since some rich Arabs still have a string of wives and many children. So family businesses may have a multiplicity of shareholders. Unless there is careful planning, the rules tend to make it hard to arrange for the most able or meritorious of the descendants to take over. The original owners can make bequests and transfers in their lifetime, but many do not. As there is no inheritance tax in any of the GCC countries, there is little incentive to make early handovers. Many owners are loth to step down early or even admit their mortality. 
Courts in the Gulf have generally been ill-equipped to deal with such matters. But governments are beginning to improve the laws. When Majid al-Futtaim, founder of a retail empire headquartered in Dubai worth more than $16bn, died in December 2021, Dubai’s leadership appointed a “special judicial committee” to help resolve disputes that arose between his ten immediate heirs: three wives, a son and six daughters. 
 In January the UAE issued a family-companies law that spells out arbitration methods. Family businesses need proper constitutions and rules of succession. So far, however, it is optional for family firms to sign up to the new law. Oman and Saudi Arabia have also begun to take similar action.
Walid Chiniara, author of “Dynastic Planning”, who advises Saudi families, says more of his clients see the need for urgency. “I hear them say ‘I saw my friends fighting—I don’t want this to happen to my family’.” ■
