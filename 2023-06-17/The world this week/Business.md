The easing of inflationary pressures was a big factor behind the Fed’s decision. America’s overall annual  rate fell to 4% in May, the lowest it’s been since March 2021. Core inflation, which strips out energy and food prices, was 5.3%: it has hardly budged since the start of the year, in part because housing-related costs are rising. Despite higher mortgage rates, house prices are steadily increasing again.

Retail sales and industrial production grew more slowly than economists had expected in the year to May. Unlike the rest of the world, inflation is negligible and the property market is in the doldrums. 
New figures showing that wages are soaring in  probably mean that more interest-rate rises from the Bank of England are on the cards. The data caused the yields on short-term government bonds to jump to their highest levels since August 2008, higher even than the spike after the ill-fated mini-budget of Liz Truss’s government last September.

America’s stock exchange agreed to buy , a provider of risk-management and regulatory software, for $10.5bn. Nasdaq is best known for the tech firms that list their shares on the exchange. It reckons the deal will boost its financial-compliance services. 
In Japan the  stockmarket index closed above the 33,000 mark for the first time since 1990. It was boosted this week in part by a surge in the share price of SoftBank, amid rumours that it might team up with the firm behind ChatGPT.

The Federal Trade Commission asked a court to stop  completing its $69bn takeover of , a video-gaming company, amid reports that the closure of the deal is imminent.

New York introduced a minimum wage for  of $17.96 an hour, plus tips, which rises to $19.96 in 2025. The minimum wage for other workers in the city is $15.
