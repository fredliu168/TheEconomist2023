THE PRIVATISATION programme of the government of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s has in many quarters been acclaimed as one of its great successes. Even the most doctrinaire socialist would pause before advocating the return of British Airways or BT, the former telecoms monopoly, to public ownership. The programme was seen as a British innovation that set the standard for many other countries. It was widely emulated across the developed world.
More recently, however, it has come under sustained criticism. The current Conservative government has felt obliged to return some regional rail operators to the public sector because of poor service. And in recent weeks the financial problems of Thames Water, which serves 15m customers in London and the Thames Valley, have prompted heavy criticism of the privatisation in 1989 and subsequent regulation of the water industry in England and Wales.
So has privatisation run its course, and is it now to be seen as a discredited failure? I think not. I was a leading proponent of selling state-owned assets as a minister in the Thatcher government, and I remain convinced of its merits.
There were two principal motives for privatisation. First it enabled access to the provision of private capital. As government budgets came under increasing pressure and excessive borrowing was penalised by the markets that provided the lending, other ways of financing much-needed capital spending looked increasingly attractive. Private capital would of course have to be rewarded, but there seemed little difference between paying dividends to private shareholders and paying interest to lenders. Either way, the providers of capital have to make an acceptable profit. There is no such thing as a free lunch.
The second motive was a desire to increase efficiency and a belief that the discipline of the private sector would be a means of achieving this. Younger readers may view this argument with some scepticism, but the frustration of being told by a nationalised telephone company that it would take three long months before it could install a line in my first flat is still seared on my memory.
Things undoubtedly became more complicated when natural monopolies such as water and electricity were privatised. The pressure of competition, which is of course the key to private-sector efficiency, was absent, so it was recognised that regulation would be necessary.
When we privatised the water industry we established three bodies with responsibility for regulation. The National Rivers Authority, which later became the Environment Agency, was responsible for the quality of our rivers and beaches; the Drinking Water Inspectorate was responsible for the quality of the water coming out of our taps; and Ofwat was given the task of overseeing the operation of the water companies. Ofwat in particular was to protect the interests of consumers, secure the long-term resilience of water supply and waste-water systems, and ensure that the companies carried out their functions and were able to finance them.
Any assessment of the performance of the industry since privatisation must take into account the scale of the investment that has flowed over the past three decades. It amounts to something in the region of £190bn ($300bn). Many will say this has not been enough, and for some nothing will ever be enough. But can it be seriously contended that more would have been spent if the industry had had to compete for public funds with hospitals, schools and prisons?
Currently the industry is undertaking a further large investment programme to deal with the challenges that water companies and consumers still face—not least the widespread discharge of raw sewage into rivers as the companies struggle to deal with storm overflows. How easy would it be to finance that programme through public borrowing when the national debt has risen to 100% of GDP?
Much of today’s controversy has been caused by the levels of debt which some of the privatised water companies have used to finance their activities; Thames Water has borrowings of £14bn. And Ofwat does have the responsibility of ensuring that the companies are able to finance their operations. But hindsight is a wonderful thing and water companies have not been alone in taking advantage, perhaps excessively so, of the era of low interest rates which has recently come to an end.
One of the tools given to the regulators has been the ability to impose fines on the companies if they fail to comply with their obligations. Again, some would argue that the fines have not been big or frequent enough. But what sense would it make if the industry was in public ownership and the Environment Agency were to fine the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the government department responsible?
Inevitably, in drawing up a balance-sheet of the achievements of privatisation there will be some examples which will be seen as more successful than others. That is true of most, if not all, policy innovations. But overall its contribution to the effective functioning of modern economies, not just that of Britain, has been overwhelmingly positive. There are always lessons to be learned but privatisation is a striking example of an initiative which will endure.■
