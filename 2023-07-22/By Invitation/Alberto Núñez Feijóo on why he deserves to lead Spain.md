ON JULY 23RD I will have the honour of leading the People’s Party (PP) in the Spanish general election. If Spaniards give me their confidence, the mission of my government will be to revive the Spanish economy, restore faith in our institutions and ensure that our welfare state works well. We need to rebuild the core pillars of credibility, stability and the rule of law that the incumbent populist-socialist coalition has compromised.
Worryingly, despite a reform effort after the European debt crisis, the Spanish economy has been stagnating for well over a decade. Spain’s per-person GDP today is the same as 15 years ago, compared with a 12% increase for the EU as a whole. As a result, the gap with the EU average, which had narrowed sharply in the 45 years before the crisis, has reopened since. Unemployment in Spain is still the highest in the EU and, at 12.7%, more than double the average across the bloc.
The succession of crises is not an excuse: crises have affected all European economies, but Spain has fared worse. Real GDP per person fell by 2.4% between 2019 and 2022 in Spain, while in the EU as a whole it grew by 2.7%.
My government will recover the reformist ambition that flourished briefly in Spain after the financial crisis and the economic rigour that characterised the governments of Mariano Rajoy and José María Aznar (my PP predecessors), as well as the first socialist governments in the 1980s, and was lost by the current left-populist government. Only an administration committed to reforming Spain will return us to growth and to the path of convergence with the rest of Europe.
Our strategy leverages our strengths. First, the move to clean energy will significantly favour Spain: we can be in solar and wind energy what Texas is to oil and gas. Second, regardless of what artificial intelligence does to jobs, high-value-added tourism (relying on our excellent infrastructure, food, historical sites and outstanding health care) will flourish in the coming decades. Spain is, and will remain, a quality-of-life superpower. We must ensure talent and new ventures flow to where life is more pleasant, as they now do in America. Third, the time after the euro-zone crisis was not all wasted: the economy enjoys a robust external surplus, relying on an outstanding export performance and a solid banking system. And since the crisis companies and families have reduced their debts significantly.
The present government has squandered these strengths. A coalition involving populists, communists and socialists, supported by several separatist parties, it has replaced growth strategies with populist spending. Between 2019 and 2022 Spain’s public-debt-to-GDP ratio increased by the most of any EU country despite increased taxation. That is why Spain urgently needs reforms.
Upon taking office, we will initiate two critical measures that will immediately yield growth dividends. We will streamline the administration of NextGenerationEU funds to help small and medium-sized companies, thereby eliminating reams of red tape, and convert as much money as possible from subsidies to tax deductions, which will boost manufacturing investment. We will also overturn the decision to decommission all our nuclear plants. Leveraging our strategic position as an energy hub, we will ensure low and stable energy prices, inviting foreign investment.
But long-term growth requires a broad spectrum of reforms. The current government has undermined the independence and competence of key institutions, including the judiciary. This is undemocratic and scares off foreign investment. My party is committed to promoting a true programme of democratic regeneration to guarantee our institutions serve citizens. 
We will also have to remedy Spain’s traditional weakness in human capital investment. We must invest in first-rate universities, in vocational training paid for with vouchers for workers (rather than subsidies) and in supporting families and maternity. We must also become attractive to foreign talent. 
Finally, Spain needs in-depth reform of the public administration and permitting and regulation processes, which are largely responsible for the small size of Spanish firms and which make it impossible to expand green-energy investment at the speed required. We need to cut red tape in a variety of areas, including the process for starting a business.
If Spaniards give us their support, my government will also be presiding over the Council of the European Union. During Spain’s presidency, some of our priorities will be supporting Ukraine, agreeing on anti-money-laundering legislation and deepening our economic and monetary union. Spain is well positioned to be a bridge between the north and south of Europe concerning deficit rules: we are responsible, and we believe in both the need for fiscal discipline and in flexibility within the rules. More broadly, we believe that Europe needs fewer rules, more innovation and a strong European single market to compete with China and America.
This election offers Spain the chance to break free from economic stagnation and return to reform and stability. If elected, my government pledges competence and rule of law instead of the populism and fantasy economics of the current coalition.■
