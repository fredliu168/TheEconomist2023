At the heart of the drama lies the much-revered “debt brake”, a constitutional clause that limits the country’s budget deficit, but which the government has resorted to circumventing through a series of special funds. On November 15th the country’s constitutional court ruled that one such wheeze to finance €60bn ($66bn), or 1.5% of GDP, in climate spending was illegal, jeopardising all the financing done in this way. \nThe consequences have been shambolic. As lawmakers have scrambled to plug fiscal holes, members of the ruling coalition have resorted to squabbling and the opposition are divided, too. On November 28th Olaf Scholz, the Social Democratic chancellor, promised in the Bundestag that some fixes would be found. The government will invoke an emergency clause to ensure its spending for 2023 passes legal muster, but there was no explanation of where the money for future years would come from.

A similar fund could be set up to permit debt-financed infrastructure and climate investment over the long term. This would need a majority in two-thirds of both houses of parliament, which the coalition alone would not have. But it would be far-sighted of the Christian Democrats, the largest opposition party, to co-operate. The cdu was the main party of government between 2005 and 2021, and the chief architect under Angela Merkel of the debt brake.

Germany’s reputation for prudence was won not because of the debt brake itself, but because years of strong growth boosted its tax receipts and flattered the deficit figures. As much as Germans love their rules, to put the debt brake before achieving growth today would be a perverse act of self-harm. Much better instead to enshrine principles such as debt sustainability in the constitution, and to leave deficit limits to elected politicians. Germany has many problems. Excessive public debt is not one of them. ■","description":"Three steps to resolve the fiscal panic","ogDescription":"Three steps to resolve the fiscal
