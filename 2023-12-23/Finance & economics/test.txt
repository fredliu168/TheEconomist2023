The rich and high-status seize power for personal gain, and periodically dole out services, such as a road, school or police force, in order to keep populations on board.

The study is not flawless. Perhaps an unknown conquest explains the spread of settlements in the period under consideration. Maybe the authors are wrong and the pattern does not hold elsewhere. There were already six cities and many more settlements in the Mesopotamian Valley before its rivers really began to move, and some had existed for a thousand years.
